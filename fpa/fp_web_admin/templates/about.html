		<h1>About FieldPrime</h1>
		<h2>History</h2>
		<p>
			FieldPrime was designed and developed in the Computation Biology unit of the CSIRO Agricultural Flagship. Its initial
               purpose was to support the data collection and management needs for various field trials of wheat lines run by
               Dr Colin Cavanagh.  The software is, however, broadly applicable to many situations requiring the collection and
               collation of data, and hence is made available on request for not-for-profit use, subject to approval.
