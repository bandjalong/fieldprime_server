					<h2>FieldPrime app version 0.1 released <span>Michael Kirk</span></h2>
					<p>
					  New version of the app with quite a few changes,
					  including:
                      <ul>
                        <li>
                          When you open a trial, there is now a browse
                          mode as well as a score mode, the browse
                          mode allows you to view all the current
                          scores and notes on the device (or some
                          subset of them you can select), and the
                          score mode is as it was before. You swipe
                          the screen left or right to switch between
                          these.
                        <li>
                          The number of property widgets can be
                          modified. By default it is still 2, but you
                          can change this from a menu accessed by
                          touching the FieldPrime logo in the top left
                          of the screen.
                      </ul>
					</p>
				</li>
