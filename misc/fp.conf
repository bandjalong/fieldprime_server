# fp.conf
# Michael Kirk 2013
#
# Apache config for various field prime pages.
# This file is included by name in the apache2.conf file,
# just after the module configurations are Included. EG
#   Include fp.conf
#

#
# Entry point for the FieldPrime app and user web interfaces:
# This for the flask web services. The WSGIScriptAlias commands define
# entry points, the WSGIPythonPath entry is necessary for the entry point
# code to be able to access python packages in the fpa directory.

# Entry point for the app web service (i.e. the app talks to here):
WSGIScriptAlias /fprime ***REMOVED***/fpa/wsgi_app_entry.py

# Entry point for the user web interface:
WSGIScriptAlias /fieldprime ***REMOVED***/fpa/wsgi_adm_entry.py

# Where to look for packages:
WSGIPythonPath ***REMOVED***/fpa

# Make the fpa directory visible:
# I can't remember whether this is essential, need to test..
Alias /fpa/ ***REMOVED***/fpa/
<Directory ***REMOVED***/fpa/>
  Order allow,deny
  Allow from all
</Directory>

#
# Stuff for the current web admin interface. This does not use Flask,
# and I intend to replace this, or port it, to a Flask set up.
# It is in use, however, at the time of writing, so the stuff below
# may be necessary.

# Make the fp directory visible, and executable:
#Alias /fp/ ***REMOVED***/fp/
#<Directory ***REMOVED***/fp/>
#  AddHandler cgi-script .py
#  Options +ExecCGI
#</Directory>


#
# Mod rewrite stuff. Note, to work this requires some magic in the VirtualHost stuff.
# Specifically, in the file:
#   /etc/apache2/sites-enabled/***REMOVED***-ssl.conf
# We have to add the lines:
#   RewriteEngine on
#   RewriteOptions Inherit
#

#<IfModule mod_rewrite.c>
#RewriteEngine on
#RewriteLog "/var/log/apache2/rewrite.log"
#RewriteLogLevel 3
#RewriteRule ^/fieldprime$ /fp/fpMain.py [PT]
#RewriteRule ^/fpclient$ /fprime/datareap.php [PT]
#</IfModule>
